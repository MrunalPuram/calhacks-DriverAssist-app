# Driver Assist

Created an iOS app for Cal Hacks 5.0, that uses Ford's SmartDeviceLink API. Example source code was cloned from [https://github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_ios].

To test code, you must first download the emulator software from smartdevicelink.com. After you download the repository, set the target to build to SmartDeviceLink-Example-Swift. When you run the code in the simulator, connect through TCP Debug, by using your IP Address and port 12345.
